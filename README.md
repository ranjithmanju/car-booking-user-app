## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It uses TypeScript for type safety and includes various dependencies for functionality.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ranjithmanju/car-booking-user-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd car-booking-user-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

## Usage

After starting the application, you can navigate through the app to book vehicles. The main features include:

- Selecting secured or standard vehicles.
